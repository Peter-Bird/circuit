# Digital Source:

- Identified by a label ("Source").
- Equipped with a single output port.
- Establishes a connection exclusively with one wire ("Wire 1").
- Optionally, the connection point can be labeled (e.g., "J1") for clarity.

- Outputs a high logic-level voltage at its port when active.

- Optional operational state:
1. On - active, outputting high logic-level.
2. Off - inactive, a high-impedance state (Z).
